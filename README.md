# Salud_healthmonitoring
Health monitoring program. Ideal to store the blood pressure, heart beat rate and weight data. It is in Spanish 
This program was something that I wrote while learning Python. Therefore, it is not that sofisticate but it works well. I use it everyday.

One has to get all the packages imported in order to run it. I used python3 and I have not tested if it can work well under python2.
The program is in Spanish and it will store the data that one will input as .csv files and then one can plot the data using the program itself.
